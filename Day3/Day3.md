# React-Scripts

<strong> Day3: 18th July 2022 <br /><br /> </strong>
<em> On this day I learnt about the folder structre that npx create-react-app created. What lies in package.json file in your react app. </em>

<li> The package.json file contains all the information about the packages and the versions that your project is using.
<li> We will be first looking at the scripts in the package.json file: <br /><br/>

 <li> Read scripts were developed to better build our application and to test it.
  <li> If you write "npm start" in your command line, the start in npm start takes all your code and pushes it throught localhost to render. Once you have written npm start the output in localhost for the very first time will look like this: <br/>

  <li> If you write in the command line: npm run build it will make a production build for your application and this will create a folder in your directory called as build. <br />

  <li>Now coming to starting point of our React app it's: Index.js.
    <li> In index.js if you see there the first two import statements importing from react and react DOM. <br />

  <li> 'react' specifies that it's an underlying engine and Dom is used for website development.

<em>Resuming this thread again as I'm learning about React basics.(It's very tough for me to understand it 😥 <br /> 
but hopefully things will get
easier 🤩😎 !!)
It took me almost 12 days to learn about the basics in React.</em><br /> 

This was what I had learned on <strong>Day-2: 17th July 2022</strong>

# React Basics
Today I learnt about some of the React basics and had done the
environment setup for React.
I learnt about:
<li> <strong>NPM :</strong> It is the package manager for the JavaScript runtime
environment Node.js this contains all the packages and libraries which
are required in development of out project.
<li> Contrary to popular belief npm is not and acroynm for Node Pacakage Manager. For more info check out here: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) <br />

<li> <strong>Create-React-App :</strong> The command used to create a react app is npx create-react-app. NPX was introduced in the latest versions of Npm.
Earlier when there was no, npx to create a react application the command:npm -g install create-react-app.
Create React App basically scaffolds and loads the basic required files for you react project.
 <li> The main difference between npm and npx is that npm installs a package on your drive but npx on the other hand downloads it and executes it immediately so, that it doesn't clog the memory.
 
   
  So, had setup the project that basically took an entire hour. But stay tuned for more learnings on React. 😁
